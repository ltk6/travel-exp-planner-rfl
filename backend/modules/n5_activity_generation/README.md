# N5 Activity Generation Module

N5 generates candidate activities for each location in a result set. It uses an LLM-first strategy with a configurable provider chain, falls back to template expansion when LLM output is missing or insufficient, and returns a flat list of activity records plus per-location generation diagnostics.

## Responsibilities

- Accept user preferences, candidate locations, and optional timing constraints
- Normalize and validate incoming user and location payloads
- Generate activities for each location via the configured LLM provider chain
- Fall back to template-based generation when LLM output is absent or below threshold
- Deduplicate activities by name within each location
- Return structured activity metadata and per-location generation diagnostics

## Module Structure

```
backend/modules/n5_activity_generation/
├── __init__.py                  # Re-exports generate_activities
├── pipeline.py     # Orchestration: normalize → LLM → template → dedup
├── llm_provider.py          # LLM prompt construction and response parsing
├── config.py
├── schemas.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Public API

```python
from modules.n5_activity_generation import generate_activities
from backend.shared.contracts.n5_contracts import N5GenerateInput

generate_activities(data: Union[N5GenerateInput, dict]) -> dict
```

`generate_activities()` enforces Pydantic V2 validation at the module boundary.

## Input Contract

```python
class N5UserInput(BaseModel):
    text: Optional[str] = ""
    tags: List[str] = []
    img_desc: Optional[str] = ""

class N5LocationMetadata(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    tags: List[str] = []
    coordinates: Optional[Dict[str, Optional[float]]] = None
    address: Optional[str] = None

class N5LocationItem(BaseModel):
    location_id: str
    metadata: Optional[N5LocationMetadata] = None

class N5Constraints(BaseModel):
    time_of_day: Optional[str] = "anytime"

class N5GenerateInput(BaseModel):
    user: N5UserInput
    locations: List[N5LocationItem] = []
    constraints: Optional[N5Constraints] = None
    provider_override: Optional[str] = None
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `user` | User preferences: free text, tags, and image description |
| `locations` | Locations to generate activities for |
| `constraints` | Optional timing constraint (`time_of_day`) |
| `provider_override` | Force a specific LLM provider (skips chain order) |

## Output Shape

N5 has no formal Pydantic output model. Malformed LLM items are dropped internally. The returned dict is:

```python
{
    "activities": [
        {
            "activity_id": str,          # {source}_{location_id}_{hash6}
            "location_id": str,
            "metadata": {
                "name": str,
                "description": str,
                "tags": list[str],
                "activity_type": str,    # adventure|relaxation|food|culture|nightlife|nature|shopping
                "intensity": float,
                "physical_level": float | None,
                "social_level": float | None,
            }
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "per_location": [
            {
                "location_id": str,
                "provider_used": str | None,
                "model_used": str | None,
                "usage": dict | None,
                "latency_ms": int,
            }
        ],
        "latency_ms": int,
    }
}
```

- `activities` is a flat list across all input locations
- Malformed or incomplete items are silently dropped by N5's internal JSON parser
- When used in the N8 `activities_v2_service`, N5 output is validated against `N3ActivityItem` before merging with DB-backed activities

## Generation Flow

For each location:

1. Normalize the user input and location metadata
2. Build a travel-context prompt (location name, tags, user preferences)
3. Try the LLM provider chain in order (Groq → Gemini by default)
4. Accept LLM output if enough valid activities are returned
5. Fill gaps or fully fall back with template expansion when needed
6. Deduplicate activities by name within the location
7. Accumulate into the flat output list

---

## LLM Provider Chain

N5 uses a prioritized provider chain managed by `providers/registry.py`:

- **Groq** (primary): fast, free-tier, rate-limited — tried first
- **Gemini** (fallback): used when Groq fails or is rate-limited

Each provider implements retry logic and RPM-limit awareness via `providers/base.py`. The chain is exposed as `get_llm_chain()` and is also used by `processor.py` (activity retrievals) for description enrichment.

## Runtime Notes

- The module short-circuits to an empty result when generation count is configured to `0`
- Template generation can add diversity modifiers when extra coverage is needed
- Sightseeing-oriented activities may be boosted to maintain variety in the returned set
- Activity types are drawn from the 7-value enum: `adventure`, `relaxation`, `food`, `culture`, `nightlife`, `nature`, `shopping`
- Logging covers generation progress and per-location timing via the project logging helper
